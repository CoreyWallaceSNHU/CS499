**📌 Overview**

This repository contains my final project for CS‑499: Computer Science Capstone at Southern New Hampshire University. The purpose of this project is to demonstrate my growth as a software engineer through a series of enhancements to prior coursework artifacts. These enhancements align with the three major competency areas defined by the program:

Software Engineering and Design
Algorithms and Data Structures
Databases

To showcase my development throughout the program, I selected previously completed work and improved it according to these categories. Each artifact has been enhanced, documented, and justified for inclusion in my professional ePortfolio.


**🎯 Project Purpose**

The goal of this capstone is to refine and strengthen previous work by applying industry‑aligned best practices, advanced design principles, and improved technical methodologies. These enhancements demonstrate my mastery of the CS program learning outcomes, including:

Designing and implementing maintainable, scalable software
Enhancing existing code through improved structure, readability, and efficiency
Applying algorithmic reasoning to optimize logic and performance
Implementing secure, well‑structured database interactions
Communicating technical ideas clearly through documentation and code review



**📂 Repository Contents**

This repository includes the following components:
1. Enhanced Artifact(s)
Updated source code files showing improvements in design, logic, and implementation.
Each artifact includes:

The original unmodified version
The enhanced version
A written enhancement summary

2. Enhancement Plan
A detailed document outlining the planned modifications for each artifact, explaining why each change is necessary to meet the CS program outcomes.
3. Professional Self‑Assessment
A narrative reflection discussing:

My growth throughout the Computer Science program
Skills demonstrated through the artifact enhancements
How my work showcases readiness for professional practice

4. Code Review Video
A walkthrough of the artifacts and proposed enhancements.
